# MCP Simple StreamableHttp Stateless Server Example

> Adapted from the [official Python MCP SDK example](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/tree/main/examples/servers/simple-streamablehttp-stateless)

A stateless MCP server example demonstrating the StreamableHttp transport without maintaining session state. This example is ideal for understanding how to deploy MCP servers in multi-node environments where requests can be routed to any instance.

## Features

- Uses the StreamableHTTP transport in stateless mode (mcp_session_id=None)
- Each request creates a new ephemeral connection
- No session state maintained between requests
- Task lifecycle scoped to individual requests
- Suitable for deployment in multi-node environments


## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
# Using default port 3000
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp-stateless

# Using custom port
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp-stateless --port 3000

# Custom logging level
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp-stateless --log-level DEBUG

# Enable JSON responses instead of SSE streams
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp-stateless --json-response
```

The server exposes a tool named "start-notification-stream" that accepts three arguments:

- `interval`: Time between notifications in seconds (e.g., 1.0)
- `count`: Number of notifications to send (e.g., 5)
- `caller`: Identifier string for the caller


## Client

You can connect to this server using an HTTP client. For now, only the TypeScript SDK has streamable HTTP client examples, or you can use [Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) for testing.
